# Vodka sauce

Rich, creamy tomato sauce... not sure what the vodka does for it, but it's good!

## Ingredients

* 2 tbsp. olive oil
* 1 tbsp. butter
* 1 medium onion, finely diced
* 4-6 cloves garlic, diced
* 3/4 to 1 cup vodka
* 1 14 oz. can diced tomatoes
* 1 cup heavy cream
* red pepper flakes
* salt, pepper to taste
* 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese (fresh, not the sawdust in plastic shakers)
* 1 pound cooked pasta

## Instructions

Puree tomatoes (entire contents of can, including juice) in food processor or blender until smooth. In a large pan, cook onion and garlic, seasoned with salt and pepper, in butter and olive oil over medium heat until starting to brown.

Add vodka, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until most of liquid is gone. Add pureed tomato and simmer until thick. These simmering steps will take time; don't try to rush, let the sauce develop flavor! Reduce heat to low, add heavy cream, and stir in. Taste and add seasoning if needed. Heat, then add Parmesan and pasta and mix until cheese is melted and thoroughly combined with pasta and sauce.

Top with some additional Parmesan for serving, if desired.
