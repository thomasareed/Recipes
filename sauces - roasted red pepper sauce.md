# Roasted red pepper sauce

Goes nicely on pasta, pizza, etc.

## Ingredients

* 4 red peppers
* 2 cloves minced garlic
* salt & pepper
* 1 tsp balsamic vinegar
* 3 tbs olive oil

## Instructions

Roast the peppers until blackened. Put them in a paper bag or a bowl covered with plastic wrap and leave them for 5 minutes, then remove them and peel off the skin. Remove the seeds and chop roughly.

Process all ingredients in a blender or food processor until smooth.

Works really well as the sauce on pizza with caramelized onions, kalamata onions, and feta cheese!
