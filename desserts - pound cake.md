# Pound cake

## Ingredients

* 2 3/4 cups sugar
* 1/2 pound butter
* 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 pint sour cream
* 3 cups flour, sifted three times
* 6 eggs
* 1 teaspoon vanilla (may also add Â½ teaspoon almond or lemon flavoring)
* 1/4 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

Have all ingredients at room temperature. Cream together the butter and sugar until light. Add eggs, one at the time, and beat in well.

Mix dry ingredients and add alternately with the sour cream. Blend until smooth, but do not overdo mixing. Add flavoring at the end.

Bake in a greased and papered tube pan or a greased bundt pan lightly dusted with flour before pouring in the batter. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Bake for 90 minutes or until the cake is done. If you use a tube pan, cool for about 20 minutes in the pan and then lift out the bottom. Using a bundt pan, cool only briefly in the pan before turning the cake out onto a rack.
