# Chocolate ice cream

Can adapt this to other kinds of ice cream. The eggs make it very rich and delicious!

## Ingredients

* 5 oz semisweet chocolate, finely chopped
* 2 cups heavy cream
* 2 cups whole milk
* 2 egg yolks
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1 tbs vanilla extract

## Instructions

Combine cream, milk and chocolate in a saucepan and cook over medium heat until almost boiling (about 5-8 minutes). Reduce heat to low. While heating, beat yolks, sugar and vanilla until smooth. Add a small amount (1/4 to 1/2 cup) of warm cream/chocolate to the yolks, stirring well. (This tempers the eggs; if you add them directly to the hot cream, you'll get scrambled eggs in your ice cream!) Gradually add yolk mixture to cream/chocolate, stirring constantly. Cook over low heat until slightly thickened (about 3-4 minutes). Cool completely (in refridgerator overnight or in ice bath for 30 minutes).

Pour into ice cream machine and turn on. Run fur 25-30 minutes, adding chocolate chunks, nuts, etc 5 minutes before the end of the cycle if desired. Spoon into container and put in freezer until firm.
