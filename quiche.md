# Quiche

## Ingredients

* 2 cups finely cubed potatoes
* 1/2 package of bacon
* 1/2 medium onion, diced
* large handful spinach, roughly chopped
* 1 cup cheddar cheese
* 2 eggs
* 1 cup half-and-half
* salt and pepper to taste
* pie crust

## Instructions

Chop up bacon, cook in non-stick skillet on medium-low heat (to avoid excessive spattering) until crisp. Remove from bacon fat and place on paper towels.

Put pie crust into quiche pan (a regular pie pan will do in a pinch). Beat eggs and half and half, adding salt and pepper.

Remove most of bacon fat, cook potatoes in pan. Once potatoes are mostly done, add onions. When onions are mostly done, add spinach and cook until wilted. Move veggies to a bowl to cool slightly. Once cooler, mix in bacon and cheese, and add to quiche pan. Pour egg mixture over the ingredients in the quiche pan.

Bake at 400Â° for 35-40 minutes.
