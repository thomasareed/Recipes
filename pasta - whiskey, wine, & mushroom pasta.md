Amazingly rich and flavorful!

## Ingredients

* 24 oz sliced mixed mushrooms
* 4 tbsp olive oil (divided)
* 2 tbsp butter
* 1 large onion, sliced
* 1 cup dry white wine
* 3/4 cup whiskey
* 1/2 cup chicken broth
* 1 cup heavy cream
* salt, pepper
* 12-16 oz pasta

## Instructions

Drizzle mushrooms with 1/2 olive oil, salt/pepper. Roast for 20-25 min at 375 degrees.

Saute onion in rest of olive oil and butter over medium heat, in a large pan, until starting to brown. Turn heat down to medium-low, pour in wine and whiskey and reduce. Add broth and reduce again. Add mushrooms and reduce again, once again until most liquid is gone.

While reducing, cook the pasta. Drain when slightly underdone.

Add cream to pan and reduce heat to low. Heat for a few minutes. Toss in cooked pasta and finish cooking for a few minutes in the sauce.
