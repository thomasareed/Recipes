# Basic cream sauce

This is the basis of many cream sauces. Add cheese for mac & cheese, garlic and parmesan for creamy alfredo, etc.

## Ingredients

* 1 tbsp. butter
* 1 tbsp. flour
* 1/2 cup milk

## Instructions

Melt butter in a pan over medium heat. Add flour, whisking it thoroughly, and cook for at least 5 minutes. Lower heat and whisk in milk. Heat, stirring often, until sauce is thick.

If adding cheese to the sauce, add in batches, whisking it in until fully melted and incorporated.

You can make as much sauce as you need by just multiplying the quantities.
