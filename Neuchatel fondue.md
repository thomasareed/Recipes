# Neuchâtel fondue

Makes 8 turnovers. Nice appetizer for a small group.

## Ingredients

* 2-4 cloves garlic, diced
* 2/3 cup dry white wine
* 1 tsp. lemon juice
* 10 ounces Emmentaler cheese, grated
* 10 ounces Gruyère cheese, grated
* 1 tbsp. corn starch
* 3 tbsp. Kirsch
* pinch of ground nutmeg
* pinch of paprika
* black pepper

## Instructions

Toss cheese with corn starch. Pour wine, Kirsch, and lemon juice into pot, add garlic and heat gently. Gradually add the cheese, stirring until melted and smooth. Serve with cubes of rye, pumpernickel or French bread, sliced apple, and cauliflower florets.

Grate your own nutmeg with a microplane or grater at the time of use for best results; it's far more flavorful than pre-ground.
