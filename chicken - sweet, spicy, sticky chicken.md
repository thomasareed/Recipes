# Sweet, spicy, sticky chicken

## Ingredients

* 2 tbsp brown sugar
* 4 tbsp honey
* 1/2 cup soy sauce
* 3-4 tsp chopped ginger root
* 4 tsp chopped garlic
* 1 tbsp Sriracha
* splash or two of OJ
* salt/pepper to taste
* 1 pound chicken, chopped into 1 inch cubes
* 1 tbsp vegetable oil
* 2 tbsp flour

## Instructions

Shake chicken chunks in flour, salt, pepper to lightly coat.

Mix together brown sugar, honey, soy sauce, ginger, garlic, hot sauce, and OJ.

Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and brown, about 2 minutes. Pour the sauce over the chicken and simmer uncovered for 8-10 minutes until sauce thickens.

Serve with rice. Also goes well with steamed broccoli. If you want more sauce, for drizzling into rice or over veggies, you can multiply the quantities for the sauce by 1.5 or 2.
