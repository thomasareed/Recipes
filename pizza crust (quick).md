# Pizza crust (quick)

Makes 2 pizzas; very little rising time is needed

## Ingredients

* 3 1/3 cups flour
* 1 tbs salt
* 1 1/3 cups warm (100°) water
* 1 tbs sugar
* 1 package dry yeast
* 1 tbs olive oil

## Instructions

Mix flour & salt in food processor. Mix sugar & yeast in water, add olive oil. Slowly add liquid to flour while processing. When dough forms a ball, remove from processor, cut in half, & form into two balls. Let rest for 10 minutes, covered loosely with plastic wrap or a damp towel. Roll into 2 crusts. Cook in 450° oven for 3-4 minutes, then remove. Either freeze or top & finish cooking.

Toppings go on the side that was down when pre-cooking. If you have pizza stones, preheat them in the oven beforehand.
