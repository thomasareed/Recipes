# French toast

Serves 3-4 people, depending on how much French toast you want. :)

## Ingredients

* 4 eggs
* 1 cup milk
* 2 tbsp sugar
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1/4 tsp nutmeg
* 1 loaf day-old bread

## Instructions

Mix first 5 ingredients, beat well. Soak bread in mixture and then cook on griddle until browned, then flip and brown on other side.

Grate your own nutmeg with a microplane or grater at the time of use for best results; it's far more flavorful than pre-ground.
