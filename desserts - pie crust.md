# Pie crust

Serves 3-4 people, depending on how many waffles you want. :)

## Ingredients

* 2 Cups sifted flour
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 Cup cold shortening or butter
* 6 Tablespoons ice water

## Instructions

Mix flour and salt and cut the shortening in. (Use a pastry cutter, mixing until you have something about the texture of coarse corn meal with an occasional pea-sized bit of shortening here and there.) Add very cold water one or two Tbs. at a time, using only enough to make a workable dough. Too much water will make it gooey and too little will leave it crumbly and hard to manage.

Form the pastry into two balls. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

Flatten each ball and roll it out on a well-floured surface. Add flour to top and bottom as you go so your pastry won’t stick to the rolling pin or the work surface. Cover with waxed paper, plastic wrap, or a kitchen towel until you are ready to put everything together.

Use left-over pastry dough: Roll out flat and sprinkle generously with cinnamon and sugar. Cut into strips and roll up into little wheels. Place the wheels on a cookie sheet and bake at 400° for about 10 minutes.
