# Crab cakes

## Ingredients

* 1 pound crab
* 1 cup bread crumbs
* 3/4 cup mayo
* 1 egg, beaten
* 2 green onions
* 1 tsp worcestershire
* 1 tsp dry mustard
* 1/2 lemon, juiced
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp garlic powder
* dash of cayenne
* pepper to taste

## Instructions

Mix all ingredients. Shape into about crab cakes of the desired size and refrigerate for 30 minutes on wax paper. Cook in oil in large pan until browned, then flip and repeat on other side. Be sure cakes are cooked through to the middle. If heat is too high, they will brown while the middle is still underdone.
