# Frito frittata

## Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1/3 pound ham steak, diced
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 1 small onion, chopped
* 1/2 small red bell pepper, diced
* 1 large jalapeno chile pepper, diced
* 2 cloves garlic, diced
* Salt and pepper
* 1 small ripe vine tomato, diced
* 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
* 1 1/2 cups Fritos corn chips, lightly crushed
* 10 eggs, lightly beaten
* 4 ounces pepper jack, diced

## Instructions

Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees. In a large, ovenproof skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the ham and cook until browned, 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate.

Add the butter to the skillet. Add the onion, bell pepper, chiles and garlic; season with salt and pepper. Cook until crisp-tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the tomato and cilantro. Scatter the ham and corn chips in the pan.

In a bowl, beat the eggs with the hot sauce; season with salt and pepper. Pour the egg mixture over the ham mixture. Scatter the cheese on top. Cook until the eggs are just set, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the frittata to the oven and bake until puffed, 12 to 15 minutes.
