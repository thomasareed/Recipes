# Split pea soup

## Ingredients

* 1 package (14 ounces) dried split peas, rinsed and cleaned
* 7 cups water
* 2 beef bouillon cubes
* several slices of ham or Canadian bacon
* 1 medium onion
* 2 to 3 peeled carrots
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper

## Instructions

Finely chop ham, onion, and carrots in a food processor. It needs to be fine, but does not have to be pureed.

Add all ingredients to a large pot and bring to a high simmer. Simmer for 1 hour, or more, until peas are soft. If necessary, add water and continue to simmer to get the soup to your desired consistency.
