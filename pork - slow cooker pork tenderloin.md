# Slow cooker pork tenderloin

You can try to slice it, but you'll probably have trouble, as it has a tendency to just fall apart.

## Ingredients

* 2 pork tenderloins
* 1 cup water
* 3/4 cup red wine
* 3 tbsp minced garlic
* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 2 tbsp worchestershire sauce
* 1 tbsp sweet chili sauce
* 1 sliced onion
* onion powder
* garlic powder
* salt
* pepper

## Instructions

Place tenderloin in slow cooker and season both sides with onion/garlic powders, salt, pepper. Place minced garlic and onion on top of the pork. Pour water, wine, soy/worchestershire sauces, chili sauce over the pork.

Cook on high for 4 hours. Remove from slow cooker and allow to rest for a few minutes before cutting or shredding. Sliced onions can be fished out and top the meat nicely.

If desired, add corn starch to some of the liquid left in the slow cooker and heat in a pot until thickened for a delicious sauce.
