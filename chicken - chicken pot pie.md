# Chicken pot pie

Makes individual "pies" in ramekins (4 of them, for large ramekins), rather than a pie pan. If you're cooking for fewer people, you can save the extra filling to use for another meal later. Simply reheat leftover filling on the stove top and use it to make more "pies" later.

## Ingredients

* Pie crust
* 1 rotisserie chicken, shredded
* 2-3 large carrots, diced
* 2-3 stalks celery, diced
* 1 large onion, diced
* 1 cup thawed frozen peas
* 1/3 cup butter
* 1/3 cup flour
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp pepper
* 1 3/4 cup chicken broth
* 2/3 cup milk

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Sautee veggies in butter until soft.

While veggies are cooking, prepare large ramekins (the right size for a single serving) with a disk of pie crust in the bottom (not covering the sides). Place on a sheet pan and bake until crust is done. Remove from oven.

Chop shredded chicken. (You probably won't need all of it; save some for other uses.) Add flour, salt, and pepper to veggies and cook for a few more minutes, then mix in chicken broth and milk. Keep stirring, ensuring flour is dissolved, until sauce is thickened, then add chicken and peas. Heat through.

Add mixture to ramekins, leaving cooked crust in the bottom. Top with a disk of uncooked pie crust slightly larger than the top of the ramekin. Bake for 10-15 minutes, until top crust is nicely browned.
