## Ingredients

* 2 poblano peppers
* 1 small onion, diced

Roast the poblanos until blackened. Put them in a paper bag or a bowl covered with plastic wrap and leave them for 5 minutes, then remove them and peel off the skin. Remove the seeds and chop roughly.

Saute the onion and garlic in butter until translucent. Add the poblano, saut√© for a couple minutes, then add the cream. Heat on low for a few minutes (do not boil!), stirring frequently.

Add the sauce to a blender or food processor and process until smooth. Taste, add salt as needed.
