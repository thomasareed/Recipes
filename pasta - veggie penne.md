# Veggie penne

## Ingredients

* 1 box penne
* 1 onion
* 1 yellow squash
* 1 zucchini
* 1/2 cup mushrooms
* 2-4 cloves garlic, diced
* 3 tbsp olive oil
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp pepper
* 1/4 tsp parsley flakes
* 1/4 tsp thyme
* 1/4 cup whipping cream

## Instructions

Cook pasta until slightly underdone.

Cut veggies into pieces of similar shape and size to the penne. (Mushrooms won't cooperate, just slice them.) Saute veggies in olive oil in a large pan over medium heat, until starting to brown.

Reduce heat to medium low, add rest of ingredients and pasta, and cook for 2-3 minutes.
