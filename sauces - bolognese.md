# Bolognese sauce

Makes a LOT of sauce! Great for serving over pasta, slathering on toasted garlic bread, etc.

## Ingredients

* 1 large onion
* 3 large carrots
* 3 ribs celery
* 6 cloves garlic
* 3 pounds ground beef, pork and/or other
* 2 cups tomato paste
* 3 cups hearty red wine
* 3 bay leaves
* 1 tbsp dry thyme (or more!)
* 1 tbsp dry Italian herbs (or more!)

## Instructions

Puree onion, carrots, celery, and garlic into a coarse paste. Add to well-oiled large pot at medium-high heat, and season well with salt and pepper. Cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring periodically, until all liquid is gone and the bottom of the pot is browning.

Add the ground meat and season again generously with salt. Cook another 15-20 minutes, stirring periodically, until liquid is gone and meat is brown. Be sure to stir frequently after first adding the meat and towards end of cooking to prevent burning at the bottom of the pot.

Add the tomato paste and cook until brown about 4 to 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the red wine and stir. Cook for another 4 to 5 minutes.

Add water to the pan until the water is about 1 inch above the meat. Add bay leaves, thyme, and Italian herbs. Simmer for 3-4 hours, adding more water as necessary. Sauce should not be watery, simmer longer if it is. (You can't simmer it too long!) Taste, adding salt if necessary.
