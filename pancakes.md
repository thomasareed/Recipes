# Pancakes

Serves 3-4 people, depending on how many pancakes you want. :)

## Ingredients

* 1.5 cups all-purpose flour
* 3 tsp. baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 2 tbsp. sugar
* 1 to 1-1/2 cups milk
* 1 egg
* 3 tbsp. butter, melted

## Instructions

Mix dry ingredients in a bowl until well-blended. Add eggs, butter and most of milk. Mix just until blended, adding more milk if needed. Pour onto hot griddle, in whatever size you like. Cook until the holes formed by bubbles don't close, then flip.

Optional: Add diced apple and a sprinkle of cinnamon or a mashed bananna and a handful of chopped pecans to the batter.
