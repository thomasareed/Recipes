# Zucchini and feta pasta

## Ingredients

* 1 head of roasted garlic
* 1 zucchini, diced
* 1 red onion, diced
* 2 ears roasted corn
* 1 cup chicken broth
* Oregano
* Rotini pasta
* Feta
* Parsley

## Instructions

Start cooking pasta. Cook until slightly underdone.

Roast garlic and corn. (In summer, roast ears of corn and foil-wrapped garlic on the grill!) Saute zucchini and onion in olive oil in a large pan. Add roasted garlic, roasted corn, chicken broth, and oregano to taste. Simmer for 5-10 minutes, until broth reduces slightly.

Add pasta and cook for 2-3 more minutes.
